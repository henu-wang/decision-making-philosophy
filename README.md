## Why Philosophy for Decisions?

Psychology tells us *how* we actually decide. Philosophy asks *how should we* decide. Both matter, but philosophy provides the normative foundation — the frameworks for what constitutes a good decision beyond just an effective one.

Every major philosophical tradition has grappled with the central question: **How should a person act in the face of uncertainty?**

## Stoicism: Control What You Can

The Stoics (Epictetus, Marcus Aurelius, Seneca) developed perhaps the most practical philosophy of decision-making ever created.

### Core Decision Principle: The Dichotomy of Control

> "Make the best use of what is in your power, and take the rest as it happens." — Epictetus

Divide every situation into:
1. **What you control**: Your judgments, intentions, desires, aversions, actions
2. **What you don't control**: Others' actions, market outcomes, weather, reputation, death

**Decision rule**: Focus all energy on (1). Accept (2) with equanimity.

### Stoic Decision-Making Techniques

| Technique | Description | Application |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| **Premeditatio Malorum** | Pre-visualize worst-case scenarios | Risk assessment before major decisions |
| **View from Above** | Imagine seeing your problem from cosmic perspective | Reduces emotional inflation of trivial choices |
| **Memento Mori** | Remember death to prioritize what matters | Career and life direction decisions |
| **Negative Visualization** | Imagine losing what you have | Gratitude-based decision calibration |
| **Voluntary Discomfort** | Practice choosing the harder path | Builds decision-making resilience |

### Marcus Aurelius on Decisions

> "You have power over your mind, not outside events. Realize this, and you will find strength."

> "The impediment to action advances action. What stands in the way becomes the way."

> "Never esteem anything as of advantage to you that will make you break your word or lose your self-respect."

Marcus wrote *Meditations* as a private journal while governing the Roman Empire — perhaps the ultimate high-stakes decision environment. His approach: decide based on virtue and duty, not outcome.

## Existentialism: Radical Freedom

Sartre, Camus, Kierkegaard, and de Beauvoir confronted decision-making head-on: you are condemned to choose, and no external authority can validate your choice.

### Core Decision Principle: Radical Responsibility

> "Man is condemned to be free; because once thrown into the world, he is responsible for everything he does." — Jean-Paul Sartre

Key ideas:
- **No excuses**: You always have a choice, even in constrained circumstances
- **Bad faith**: Pretending you don't have a choice (following rules, convention, authority) is self-deception
- **Authenticity**: Decisions should express your genuine values, not borrowed ones
- **Anguish**: The anxiety of choice is inescapable — it's the price of freedom

### Kierkegaard: The Leap of Faith

Kierkegaard argued that the most important decisions (faith, love, vocation) cannot be resolved by reason alone. At some point, you must **leap** — commit before you have certainty.

This anticipates modern research on "analysis paralysis" by 150 years.

### Camus: The Absurd Hero

> "One must imagine Sisyphus happy."

Camus argued that life's fundamental absurdity (no inherent meaning in a universe that doesn't care) doesn't justify despair. Instead, it liberates: **you create meaning through the decisions you make**, knowing there's no cosmic scorecard.

## Pragmatism: What Works

American pragmatists (William James, John Dewey, Charles Peirce) rejected abstract philosophy in favor of practical consequences.

### Core Decision Principle: Consequences Define Truth

> "The true is the name of whatever proves itself to be good in the way of belief." — William James

A belief (or decision) is "true" insofar as it works — it produces good results when acted upon.

### Dewey's Reflective Decision Process

John Dewey outlined a structured decision process still taught in education:

1. **Feel a difficulty** — sense that something needs resolving
2. **Define the problem** — specify what the decision actually is
3. **Generate hypotheses** — brainstorm possible solutions
4. **Reason through implications** — trace each option's consequences
5. **Test and observe** — implement and verify results

This is strikingly similar to the scientific method applied to everyday decisions.

## Eastern Philosophy: Non-Attachment

### Buddhism: Decide Without Clinging

> "Attachment is the root of all suffering." — attributed to the Buddha

Buddhist decision-making doesn't mean indifference — it means making choices without clinging to outcomes. The Middle Way suggests:

- Avoid extreme positions (neither indulgence nor asceticism)
- Recognize that all situations are impermanent
- Make decisions from compassion, not craving
- Accept that the outcome of any decision is uncertain

### Taoism: Wu Wei (Effortless Action)

> "Nature does not hurry, yet everything is accomplished." — Lao Tzu

Wu wei doesn't mean passivity — it means acting in harmony with the natural flow of events. The Taoist decision-maker:

- Observes patterns before acting
- Avoids forcing outcomes
- Recognizes when *not* deciding is the best decision
- Trusts in timing

### Practical Application

| Eastern Concept | Modern Decision Equivalent |
|----------------|---------------------------|
| Non-attachment | Don't let ego invest in being "right" |
| Impermanence | All decisions are revisable |
| Middle Way | Avoid extreme all-or-nothing choices |
| Wu Wei | Sometimes the best action is patient observation |
| Mindfulness | Decide from awareness, not autopilot |

## Utilitarianism: Greatest Good

### Bentham & Mill: Maximize Welfare

> "The greatest happiness of the greatest number is the foundation of morals and legislation." — Jeremy Bentham

### Decision Calculus

For any decision, utilitarianism asks: **Which option produces the most total well-being?**

| Variant | Decision Rule | Strength | Weakness |
|---------|--------------|----------|----------|
| **Act Utilitarianism** | Choose the action with best consequences | Flexible, case-specific | Impossible to calculate perfectly |
| **Rule Utilitarianism** | Follow rules that generally maximize welfare | Simpler to apply | May miss edge cases |
| **Preference Utilitarianism** | Satisfy the most preferences | Respects individual values | Whose preferences count? |

### Peter Singer's Effective Altruism

Singer applied utilitarian thinking to modern philanthropy: given limited resources, how do you help the most people? This framework has influenced billions in charitable giving.

---

## Virtue Ethics: Character First

### Aristotle: Decide as the Virtuous Person Would

> "We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit."

Aristotle's framework doesn't ask "What produces the best outcome?" but "What would a person of good character do?"

### The Doctrine of the Mean

Every virtue sits between two vices (excess and deficiency):

| Vice (Deficiency) | Virtue (Mean) | Vice (Excess) |
|-------------------|---------------|---------------|
| Cowardice | Courage | Recklessness |
| Stinginess | Generosity | Wastefulness |
| Self-deprecation | Truthfulness | Boastfulness |
| Indecisiveness | Prudence | Impulsiveness |

### Practical Insight

Virtue ethics reframes decisions from "What should I do?" to "What kind of person do I want to be?" This is particularly powerful for:
- Career decisions (identity over income)
- Relationship decisions (character over convenience)
- Ethical dilemmas (integrity over expedience)

---

## Decision Theory: Rational Choice

### Expected Utility Theory

The mathematical foundation of rational choice:

```
EU(action) = Σ [P(outcome) × U(outcome)]
```

Choose the action with the highest expected utility. Simple in theory, complex in practice because:
- Probabilities are uncertain
- Utilities are subjective
- Information is incomplete

### Game Theory

When decisions involve other decision-makers:

| Concept | Description | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| **Nash Equilibrium** | No player benefits from changing strategy alone | Pricing wars, arms races |
| **Prisoner's Dilemma** | Individual rationality leads to collective irrationality | Climate agreements, open-source |
| **Dominant Strategy** | Best regardless of what others do | Rare but powerful when found |
| **Minimax** | Minimize the maximum possible loss | Conservative investment strategy |

### Bounded Rationality (Herbert Simon)

Nobel laureate Herbert Simon recognized that real humans face:
- Limited information
- Limited computational ability
- Limited time

Therefore, we **satisfice** (seek "good enough") rather than optimize. This isn't a flaw — it's an adaptive strategy for a complex world.

## The Paradox of Choice

### Too Many Options

Barry Schwartz and Sheena Iyengar's research demonstrates:
- More options → more anxiety → worse decisions → less satisfaction
- The famous "jam study": 24 varieties led to 3% purchase rate; 6 varieties led to 30%
- Maximizers (who try to find the best option) experience more regret than satisficers

### Philosophical Resolution

- **Kierkegaard**: Commit fully once you choose; don't look back
- **Stoicism**: Accept that the outcome is beyond your control; focus on the quality of your reasoning
- **Buddhism**: Release attachment to having chosen "perfectly"
- **Pragmatism**: Any reasonable choice, well-executed, beats an optimal choice never made

---

## Applied Philosophical Decision Frameworks

### The Regret Minimization Framework (Jeff Bezos)

> "I knew that when I was 80, I would never regret having tried. I would regret not trying."

Project yourself to age 80 and ask: will I regret *not* having done this? Existentialism made practical.

### Rawls' Veil of Ignorance

For ethical/policy decisions: design the system as if you don't know what position you'll occupy in it. Powerful for:
- Organizational policy decisions
- Resource allocation
- Fairness evaluation

### The Categorical Imperative (Kant)

> "Act only according to that maxim by which you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law."

Decision test: What if everyone made this same choice? If the world wouldn't function, the choice is wrong.
